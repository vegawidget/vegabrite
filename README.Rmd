The goal of vegabrite is to provide an R api for building up vega-lite specs. For a guide on getting started using `vegabrite`, check out the [getting started vignette](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegabrite/articles/articles/introduction.html). The [example gallery](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegabrite/articles/articles/example_gallery.html) show-cases some of the many different types of plots that can be made using `vegabrite`. 

### Current status

This package is still experimental but has a mostly complete interface for building out Vega-Lite specs and charts. There is still lots of room for improvement in terms of better error handling and warnings when making invalid specs. 

## Design & Building

For some background and context on the package (previously named vegabrite) you can check out [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRUDiM3DaPjYP5b1BafSraf8GWwJk_jy6YV_l9lZgeBVwKDSfqiHcTn8M-Qm-6U7frMX7SLqQthJxah/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) from a rstudio::conf talk in January 2020. See also the [design vignette](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegabrite/articles/design.html) for an overview of the design of the package. 

Much of the public API is auto-generated via the `build.R` script in the `build` directory. The script makes uses of another package, [vlmetabuildr](https://github.com/vegawidget/vegabrite/tree/master/build/vlmetabuildr) located within the `build` directory.

## Inspiration and related work

The API for this package is heavily inspired by the [vegalite R package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite), but is rebuilt from scratch to (1) build up the API semi-automatically based on the Vega-lite schema (an approach inspired by [Altair](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair) and [vega-lite-api](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-api)) and (2) take advantage of the htmlwidget infrastucture for vega specs provided by the [vegawidget](https://github.com/vegawidget/vegawidget) package.

## Installation

`vegabrite` is not yet on cran but can be installed from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('vegawidget/vegabrite')
```


## Examples

These are some examples showing current capabilities; see [example gallery](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegabrite/articles/example_gallery.html) for more examples, including interactive ones.

```{r example}
library(vegabrite)
vl_chart() %>%
   vl_add_data(values = mtcars) %>%
   vl_mark_point() %>%
   vl_encode_x("wt") %>%
   vl_encode_y("mpg") 
```

```{r example2, warning=FALSE}
vl_chart() %>%
  vl_add_data(url = "https://vega.github.io/vega-editor/app/data/population.json") %>%
  vl_calculate(calculate = "datum.sex == 2 ? 'Female' : 'Male'", 
               as = "gender") %>%
  vl_filter("datum.year == 2000") %>%
  vl_encode(x = "age:O", y = "people:Q", color = "gender:N") %>%
  vl_stack_y("normalize") %>%
  vl_aggregate_y("sum") %>%
  vl_axis_y(title = "population") %>%
  vl_mark_bar() 
```
